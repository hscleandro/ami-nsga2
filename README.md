# Introduction
This document is about the evolutionary algorithm (EA) for the identification of active modules in biological networks called AMI-NSGA2. Using the concept of the popular algorithm NSGA-II  was developed a new method that applies multiple connected sub-graphs as candidate solution and news adapted genetics opperators (crossover and mutation) usining a singular approach based in the connection among the genes in the biological network.
